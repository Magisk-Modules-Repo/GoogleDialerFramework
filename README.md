# Dialer Framework
Dialer Framework Magisk Module for using Google Dialer / Google Phone.
This module __should__ work on almost any version of Android.

This is not associated with Google Inc. in any way.

This Magisk module installs the Dialer Framework for Google Phone.
It will __NOT__ install the Google Dialer / Google Phone application, but you can then easily install it through the Play Store.
If you're already able to install the Google Phone app from the Play Store and are not getting an error message when opening the app, then you don't need this module.
Updates for Google Phone can also be installed through the Play Store when using this module.

After version 4, it also features the "PIXEL_EXPERIENCE" feature for the device, in order to remove the "This device is unsupported and calls may not work correctly" message.
